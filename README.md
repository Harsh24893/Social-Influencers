### Highlights:

 - This is a **binary-class text classification** problem.
 - We tried several models : **Logistic Regression**, **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, **Neural Nets**, **Boosting**, **SVM**.

### Results:
 The following are the results on the test dataset. The results represent Area under the ROC curve.

| Model  | AUC |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Logistic Regression  | 0.8606  |
| XgBoost  | 0.86168 |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes  | 0.82009  |
| Neural Nets  | 0.8590 |
| SVM  | 0.8376  |
